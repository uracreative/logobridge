## Logobridge

Logobridge is a collection of unused logo proposals over the past months and years, which are getting dusty already with no one using them.
Use them as a placeholder for your project or as a template for your upcoming logo.

All logos are in the Public Domain, so you are free to do whatever you want with it (commercially as well).
They are also created with Inkscape, which is Free & Open Source Software.
Itâ€™s a great way to kick off your open source project when you need to gather something quickly.

### Website

The website was designed to be as lightweight as possible and because of this it doesn't use JavaScript to work. The underlying technology used is Jekyll and there is no framework used. CSS is built from SCSS files and everything is contained to remove the need for 3rd party assets and unnecessary connections.

This project is maintained by Ura Design.
